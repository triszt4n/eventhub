# Event Hub

My first homework project learning Ruby on Rails. Event Hub is a beginner social media app for sharing events with your future and present fans. Events --- like rock band gigs, theatrical performances, TED talks, tech shows etc. --- can be organized freely, they can be published, so that users could find them and subscribe to the posts on them.
